*This is an about page.*

This is Mouad personal digital garden. It is a place where he collects his thoughts, ideas, and notes. It is a work in progress and will be updated regularly.

For now the website is still under construction ... but stay tuned for more content!

Got bored and felt less creative so I did install Linux on my laptop cuz the make is no longer
cutting it for me. So basically I wanted to find joy again in tinkering with stuff and building things from scratch. So the blog was always a burning desire in the back of my mind and I thought why not start now. So here we are. More content to come soon. Stay tuned!
